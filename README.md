## Projects

### Customer Segmentation in E-Commerce
**Sep 2024**  
- Developed a customer segmentation model utilizing behavioral and demographic data to classify customers into ‘Core’ (regular) and ‘Up’ (premium) tiers, maximizing ‘Up’ class customers for targeted marketing.
- Employed data preprocessing, feature engineering, and supervised ML models; optimized and evaluated through hyperparameter tuning using K-fold cross-validation.
- Achieved best performance with Gradient Boosting (Recall: 0.98, F1-score: 0.76), while Random Forest (Recall: 0.96, F1-score: 0.74) demonstrated a better bias-variance trade-off, suitable for time-sensitive applications.
- Identified customer loyalty, cumulative sales, and recency of purchase as top predictors for retention strategies.
- Explored PCA and Clustering for feature reduction, optimizing model simplicity and efficiency.

### Credit Card Default Prediction Using ML
**July 2024**  
- Developed a logistic regression model to predict credit card defaults using data from the 2005 Taiwan financial crisis, enhancing risk stratification and minimizing default-related losses.
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and addressed class imbalance; implemented Bayesian logistic regression optimized via MCMC simulations, and evaluated using K-Fold Cross-Validation and Expected Log Predictive Density (ELPD) for robust performance assessment.
- Adjusted the classification cutoff (0.5 to 0.3) in Model 1, boosting sensitivity from 40% to 75.5%, improving defaulter identification in alignment with credit risk mitigation goals.
- Simplified Model 2 by using variables with high predictive power—Credit Limit and Average Repayment Status, achieving 74.3% sensitivity and 60% specificity. This approach provided an interpretable solution, optimizing credit limits and repayment strategies.
